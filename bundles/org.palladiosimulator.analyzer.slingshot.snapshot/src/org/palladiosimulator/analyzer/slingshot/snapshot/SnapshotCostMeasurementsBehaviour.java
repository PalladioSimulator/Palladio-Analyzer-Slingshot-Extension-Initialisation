	 * As a result, the intervals between the last and second to last cost

	 * 
	 * This is a certain inconsistency, but poses to significant advantages:
	 * <li>Need not save, republish and offset {@link TakeCostMeasurement} events
	 * between two simulation runs.
	 * <li>Every simulation run results in at least two cost measurements (at t=0
	 * and t = t_snapshot) which simplifies the calculation of the state utility
	 * later on.
	 * 
	 * This works independently of the order of reception of the
	 * {@link SnapshotInitiated} event. Costs are saved as part of the experiment
	 * settings, i.e. no need to ensure that the {@link TakeCostMeasurement} events
	 * are received <i>before</i> the {@link SnapshotTaken} event. It is sufficient,

	 * {@link SimulationFinished} event, which is currentl guaranteed (only
