/**
 *
 * A Record holding all Events relevant for recreating a Simulation Run.
 * 
 * The simulator has some state full component. If we cannot export the state of
 * those components, we must keep track of the events that caused that state,
 * and resend those events to recreate the state.
 * 
 * If at the point of time of taking the snaphshot, the events necessary for recreating the states
 * are already in the past, we cannot access them anymore. Thus we must record them before
 * hand.
 * 
 * Currently, those events are:
 *
 * <li>Instances of {@link UsageModelPassedElement} and
 * {@link SEFFModelPassedElement} for recreating the state of calculators. 
 *
 * <li>Instances of {@link JobInitiated} for FCFS and processor sharing
 * resources for recreating the internal state of the simulated resources. Beware:
