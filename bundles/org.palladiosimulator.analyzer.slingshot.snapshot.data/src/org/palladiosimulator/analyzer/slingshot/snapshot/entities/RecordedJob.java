/**
 *
 * Record for a single Job.
 *
 * The record contains information about a job's demand at various stages of
 * processing. The demands are important to construct a jobs that may recreate a
 * processing resource's state.
 * 
 * This record associates two demands with each {@link Job} instance, a
 * requested demand and a normalised demand. The requested demand is the demand
 * as defined in the PCM models. The normalised demand is the demand, after the
 * requested entered the simulated processing resources, because those resources
 * normalise the demand with their processing rate, c.f
 * {@code org.palladiosimulator.analyzer.slingshot.behavior.resourcesimulation.resources.active.AbstractActiveResource#onJobInitiated}.
 * 
 * And later on, when actually taking a Snapshot we need both demands, the
 * original and the normalized one, c.f.
