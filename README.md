# Palladio-Analyzer-Slingshot-Extension-StateExploration

Slingshot Extension to do state space exploration as envisioned for the MENTOR DFG project.  

Still under construction. 

At first, follow the steps in the normal Slingshot Documentation (https://palladiosimulator.github.io/Palladio-Documentation-Slingshot/tutorial/) to setup Slingshot and maybe run an (normal) example. 
Pay attention to also import the SPD meta model and the SPD interpreter extension.

Now, for the State Exploration:
* clone StateExploration Repository from GitHub: 
  - https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Analyzer-Slingshot-Extension-StateExploration
* in (already cloned) repository *Palladio-Analyzer-Slingshot* switch to branch `stateexplorationRequirements`
* in (already cloned) repository *Palladio-Analyzer-Slingshot-Extension-PCM-Core* switch to branch `stateexplorationRequirements`
- some of these state exploration requirements are temporary workarounds, others i'll try to get into the actual slingshot :)
